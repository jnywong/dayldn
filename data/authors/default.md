Dear Asian Youth London (DAYLDN) is a student-led, UK-based chapter of the non-profit Dear Asian Youth organisation. Founded in late 2020, the Instagram page provides detailed and accessible infographics on the British Asian experience, promotes independent British Asian businesses and helps shed awareness on movements such as #STOPASIANHATE.

DAYLDN’s aim is to educate and empower British Asian youth and communities, to uplift the British Asian identity, and ultimately to fight our misrepresentation in mainstream media.
